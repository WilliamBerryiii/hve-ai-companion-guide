Welcome to the execution phase. You've researched your approach and created implementation plans. Now you'll transform those plans into working code using Copilot's implementation tools: Inline Chat (`Ctrl+I`) for precise modifications, the `/new` command and Agent mode for creating new files, and Inline Suggestions for real-time code completions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Execute implementation plans using Inline Chat for precise file modifications
* Create new files and scaffolding using the `/new` command and Agent mode
* Accelerate line-level coding with Inline Suggestions
* Apply test-driven implementation workflow (write tests first, implement to pass)
* Select the optimal tool for each implementation task
* Verify each implementation step using plan-defined criteria
* Recognize when implementation diverges from plan and adapt appropriately

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before starting this chapter, verify you have:**

**Quiz - Are You Ready?**

1. ✅ Have you created an implementation plan using Task Planner? → [Review Chapter 7](../chapter7-implementation-modes/)
2. ✅ Do you understand the Implementation phase of RPI? → [Review Chapter 3, Section 4](../../part-i/chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/04-implementation-phase.md)
3. ✅ Have you completed the manual implementation exercise from Chapter 4? → [Review Chapter 4, Section 4](../../part-i/chapter4-first-workflow/04-implementation-executing-the-plan.md)
4. ✅ Can you read and understand implementation plan steps? → [Review Chapter 7, Section 3](../chapter7-task-planner/03-task-planner-structured-implementation.md)

If you answered "no" to any question, review the linked chapter before proceeding.
