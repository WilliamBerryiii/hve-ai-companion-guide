Welcome to the execution phase. You've researched your approach and created implementation plans. Now you'll transform those plans into working code using three powerful implementation modes: Edit Mode for precise modifications, Insert Mode for scaffolding new files, and Inline Copilot for rapid line-level coding.

* [Section 8: Summary](./08-summary.md)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Execute implementation plans using Edit Mode for precise file modifications
* Create new files and scaffolding using Insert Mode with template patterns
* Accelerate line-level coding with Inline Copilot suggestions
* Apply test-driven implementation workflow (write tests first, implement to pass)
* Select the optimal mode for each implementation task
* Verify each implementation step using plan-defined criteria
* Recognize when implementation diverges from plan and adapt appropriately

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before starting this chapter, verify you have:**

**Quiz - Are You Ready?**

1. ✅ Have you created an implementation plan using Task Planner? → [Review Chapter 7](../chapter7-task-planner/)
2. ✅ Do you understand the Implementation phase of RPI? → [Review Chapter 3, Section 4](../../part-i/chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/04-implementation-phase.md)
3. ✅ Have you completed the manual implementation exercise from Chapter 4? → [Review Chapter 4, Section 4](../../part-i/chapter4-first-workflow/04-implementation-executing-the-plan.md)
4. ✅ Can you read and understand implementation plan steps? → [Review Chapter 7, Section 3](../chapter7-planning-architecture-modes/03-task-planner-structured-implementation.md)

If you answered "no" to any question, review the linked chapter before proceeding.
