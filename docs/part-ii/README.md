Part II builds on the engineering foundations from Part I, guiding you through each GitHub Copilot chat mode and advanced workflow patterns. You'll learn to apply RPI framework variations across discovery, planning, and implementation scenarios, achieving proficiency in AI-assisted development through practical, evidence-based exercises.

## What You'll Learn in Part II

Part II covers RPI framework implementation through Chapter 11, introducing you to all five GitHub Copilot chat modes with practical applications:

* **Ask Mode fundamentals** for quick questions and exploration
* **Task Researcher Mode** for systematic evidence-based research with mandatory citations
* **Task Planner Mode** for strategic planning with milestone tracking
* **Edit Mode** for precision implementation and targeted refactoring
* **Agent Mode** for autonomous execution with tool integration
* **ADR Creator Mode** for documenting architectural decisions
* **Advanced workflows** including the Beads workflow for systematic task breakdown

Each chapter introduces a chat mode with clear learning objectives, hands-on exercises, and real-world scenarios. By Chapter 11, you'll have learned advanced workflow patterns that serve as foundations for the custom agents and meta-prompting techniques introduced in Part III.

## Prerequisites

Before starting Part II, you should have completed Part I (Chapters 1-4), which covers:

* Engineering-ready development practices
* Local development environment setup
* RPI framework fundamentals (Request-Proof-Implement)
* Your first RPI workflow implementation

## Chapters in Part II

### Chapter 5: Ask Mode - Quick Questions and Exploration

**Time:** 45-60 minutes | **Level:** Beginner

Learn to use Ask Mode for quick questions and conceptual exploration when you need understanding rather than implementation. Master effective question formulation with proper context, recognize incomplete answers that require alternative approaches, and apply the Extract → Verify → Learn pattern for building reliable knowledge. Complete hands-on exercises exploring codebase architecture, understanding framework decisions, and conducting discovery workflows that build toward complex tasks.

[Start Chapter 5](./chapter5-discovery-research-modes/README.md)

### Chapter 6: Task Researcher Mode - Deep Discovery

**Time:** 60-75 minutes | **Level:** Moderate

Learn to conduct systematic evidence-based research with Task Researcher mode. Master research document creation with mandatory citations, gather evidence from internal codebases using five specialized tools, leverage MCP integration for external documentation, and verify findings through triangulation. Create publication-ready research documents that prevent hallucination and build team confidence through verifiable, cited findings.

[Start Chapter 6](./chapter6-planning-architecture-modes/README.md)

### Chapter 7: Task Planner Mode - Strategic Planning

TBD

### Chapter 8: Edit Mode - Precision Implementation

TBD

### Chapter 9: Agent Mode - Autonomous Execution

TBD

### Chapter 10: ADR Creator Mode - Documenting Decisions

TBD

### Chapter 11: Advanced Workflows and Complex Scenarios

**Time:** 90-120 minutes | **Level:** Advanced

Learn advanced workflow orchestration combining multiple chat modes for complex engineering scenarios. Master the Beads workflow for systematic task breakdown across planning, architecture, implementation, and testing.

Apply hybrid approaches blending Agent Mode with Ask Mode for strategic decision-making, and implement the Capstone Project demonstrating integrated proficiency across all chat modes. This chapter introduces workflow patterns that form the foundation for Part III's custom agents and workflow orchestration.

[Start Chapter 11](./chapter11-advanced-workflows/README.md)

## Estimated Time

Completing Part II requires 8-12 hours across seven chapters, with most chapters taking 60-90 minutes. Chapter 11's Capstone Project may require additional time depending on your chosen scope.

## Reading Path Guidance

Follow the chapters sequentially (5-11) to build understanding progressively. Each chat mode builds on previous modes, and Chapter 11 integrates all patterns learned throughout Part II.

## Next Steps: Part III Advanced Prompting Patterns

After completing Part II, you'll have learned proficiency in all GitHub Copilot chat modes and advanced workflow patterns. Part III introduces advanced prompting patterns including prompt files, instruction patterns, custom agents, meta-prompting, and architectural integration. These advanced techniques build directly on the workflow foundations established in Chapter 11, enabling you to create sophisticated AI-assisted development systems.
