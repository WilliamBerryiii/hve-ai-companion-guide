## What you'll learn

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Conduct deep research using Task Researcher mode for typically 20-60 minute investigations, depending on complexity
* Create comprehensive research documents with evidence citations and line references
* Apply evidence gathering techniques across internal codebases and external sources
* Integrate MCP tools for SDK documentation and authoritative external research
* Recognize when research is "complete" and ready for planning
* Apply the D-RPI variation for unfamiliar brownfield codebases

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before starting this chapter, verify you have:**

**Quiz - Are you ready?**

1. ✅ Have you used Ask Mode for 5-10 minute discovery sessions? → [Review Chapter 5](../chapter5-discovery-research-modes/)
2. ✅ Do you understand when to escalate from Ask Mode? → Review Chapter 5, Section 2
3. ✅ Can you recognize incomplete or generic AI responses? → Review Chapter 5, Section 4
4. ✅ Do you understand the Research phase of RPI? → [Review Chapter 3, Section 2](../chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/02-understanding-rpi-framework.md)

If you answered "no" to any question, review the linked chapter before proceeding.
