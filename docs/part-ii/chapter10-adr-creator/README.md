## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Understand why architecture decision records (ADRs) are critical for long-term maintainability
* Use Ask Mode with ADR-focused prompts to document decisions in MADR format
* Capture decision context, alternatives, and rationale with AI assistance
* Integrate ADR creation into your RPI workflow (Research → ADR → Plan → Implement)
* Maintain and evolve ADRs as decisions change over time
* Build a searchable library of architecture decisions for your team
* Reference ADRs during code reviews and onboarding

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before starting this chapter, verify you have:**

**Quiz - Are You Ready?**

1. ✅ Have you completed Research and Planning chapters? → [Review Chapters 5-7](../chapter5-discovery-research-modes/)
2. ✅ Do you understand the difference between code comments and documentation? → [Review Chapter 3, Section 5](../../part-i/chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/05-documentation-tools.md)
3. ✅ Have you worked on a project where you forgot why a decision was made? → (Real-world motivation)
4. ✅ Can you identify when a decision is "architecture" vs "implementation detail"? → This chapter will clarify

If you answered "no" to questions 1-2, review the linked chapters before proceeding.
