## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Apply advanced RPI variations (D-RPI, 1→3→All, Edit+RPI, Agent+Ask) to match project complexity
* Understand Beads workflow structure with planning and execution phases
* Apply systematic task breakdown to complex features using bead structures
* Practice agent handoffs in TDD workflows with explicit context preservation
* Integrate Beads patterns with RPI variations for controlled implementation
* Switch between modes strategically while preserving context and maintaining flow
* Resolve merge conflicts efficiently using systematic AI-assisted workflows
* Implement test-driven development workflows with AI-generated tests and implementation
* Plan and execute large-scale refactorings safely with progressive implementation strategies
* Debug and recover from failed AI suggestions effectively
* Measure your AI-assisted development effectiveness and identify improvement areas
* Complete complex multi-feature projects using integrated mode workflows

## Prerequisites

This chapter assumes you have:

* ✅ Completed [Chapter 5: Discovery with Research Modes](../chapter5-discovery-research-modes/)
* ✅ Completed [Chapter 6: Planning with Architecture Modes](../chapter6-planning-architecture-modes/)
* ✅ Completed [Chapter 7: Implementation Modes](../chapter7-implementation-modes/)
* ✅ Completed [Chapter 8: Implementation Modes](../chapter8-implementation-modes/)
* ✅ Completed [Chapter 9: Agent Mode Deep Dive](../chapter9-agent-mode/)
* ✅ Completed [Chapter 10: AI Build Systems for Uniformity](../chapter10-adr-creator/)
* ✅ Familiarity with all modes learned in Part II (Ask, Task Researcher, Task Planner, Edit, Agent, ADR Creator)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is Part II's capstone chapter, integrating everything you've learned. Review earlier chapters if needed before beginning.
