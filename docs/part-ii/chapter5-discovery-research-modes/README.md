This chapter teaches you to use Ask Mode as a systematic discovery discipline. Building on Chapter 4's foundational Ask Mode techniques, you'll learn advanced question patterns, escalation criteria, and context pre-seeding strategies that transform vague requirements into precise, actionable research questions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Use Ask Mode for discovery sessions (typically 5-10 minutes) that build context rapidly
* Apply the D-RPI framework (Discovery→Research→Plan→Implement) for unfamiliar codebases
* Formulate precise, contextually-grounded research questions through iterative exploration
* Recognize when Ask Mode answers are sufficient vs. when to escalate to Task Researcher
* Pre-seed context in the same chat thread to accelerate subsequent research phases
* Identify canonical exemplars and patterns through systematic questioning

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before starting this chapter, verify you have:**

**Quiz - Are You Ready?**

1. ✅ Have you completed the full RPI workflow exercise from Chapter 4? → [Review Chapter 4](../../part-i/chapter4-first-workflow/)
2. ✅ Do you understand the three RPI phases and when to use each? → [Review Ch 3, RPI Method](../../part-i/chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/)
3. ✅ Can you recognize Type 1 inputs (uncertainty/questions) vs Type 2 (research topics)? → [Review Ch 3, Section 3](../../part-i/chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/#section-3-type-transformation-mindset)
4. ✅ Have you used Ask Mode informally for quick questions? → [Review Ch 4, Section 2](../../part-i/chapter4-first-workflow/#section-2-research-phase-with-ask-mode)

If you answered "no" to any question, review the linked chapter before proceeding.

## Chapter Contents

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

### [1. Welcome to Part II: From Foundation to Mastery](01-introduction-part-ii.md)

Understand the transition from Part I's foundational concepts to Part II's mode-specific mastery techniques. Learn what this chapter teaches and how it differs from Chapter 4's casual Ask Mode usage.

**Reading time:** 5-7 minutes  
**Pages:** 2-3

### [2. When to Use Ask Mode](02-when-to-use-ask-mode.md)

Master the decision framework for choosing Ask Mode over Task Researcher. Learn the Type 1 Input Zone characteristics, 5-10 minute timebox discipline, and escalation triggers that signal when discovery needs deeper research.

**Reading time:** 8-10 minutes  
**Pages:** 3-4

### [3. Effective Question Formulation](03-effective-question-formulation.md)

Learn the iteration pattern for refining questions from broad to focused. Explore 5 question patterns (syntax, concepts, errors, configuration, discovery) with before/after examples. Master context provision and follow-up strategies.

**Reading time:** 8-10 minutes  
**Pages:** 3-4

### [4. Recognizing Incomplete Answers](04-recognizing-incomplete-answers.md)

Identify 5 red flags indicating hallucination or speculation in AI responses. Develop probing techniques and validation strategies to verify claims. Understand when incomplete answers trigger escalation to Task Researcher.

**Reading time:** 5-7 minutes  
**Pages:** 2-3

### [5. Extract → Verify → Learn: The Discovery Quality Pattern](05-extract-verify-learn.md)

Master the three-step pattern that transforms AI responses from raw output into verified, actionable knowledge. Learn to extract testable claims, verify against reality, and integrate verified knowledge into your engineering toolkit.

**Reading time:** 8-10 minutes  
**Pages:** 3-4

### [6. The 5-10 Minute Discovery Workflow](06-discovery-workflow.md)

Follow the step-by-step discovery process with time allocations for each phase. Practice with 3 Quick Check discovery scenarios (5-7 minutes each) covering config location, concept introduction, and error interpretation.

**Reading time:** 8-12 minutes  
**Pages:** 2-3

### [7. Chapter Summary and What's Next](07-summary.md)

Review key takeaways, validate learning objectives achieved, and preview Chapter 6 (Task Researcher mode for deeper research). Explore related resources for continued learning.

**Reading time:** 3-5 minutes  
**Pages:** 2-3

**Total reading time:** 50-60 minutes  
**Total pages:** 18-21
