You started this chapter uncertain how to approach unfamiliar code. You end with a disciplined discovery practice that transforms vague problems into clear implementation plans—typically in 5-10 minutes.

## What You've Learned

This chapter taught you to use Ask Mode as reconnaissance tool for rapid codebase discovery:

**D-RPI Framework Integration**
Ask Mode performs Discovery phase work—building mental models of patterns, conventions, and canonical exemplars before committing to implementation or extensive research.

**5-10 Minute Timeboxing**
Strict time limits force question discipline. You learned to set literal timers, recognize when clarity emerges quickly versus when complexity requires escalation.

**Effective Question Formulation**
The Broad→Narrow→Specific funnel pattern systematically refines understanding. You learned five question patterns (Existence, Contextual Filtering, Exemplar Discovery, Convention Identification, Disambiguation) and four follow-up strategies (Ladder Questioning, Confirmation Loop, Alternative Exploration, Negative Discovery).

**Recognizing Incomplete Answers**
Five red flags signal insufficient answers: generic advice without codebase context, "it depends" without specifics, multiple approaches without disambiguation, no source citations, confident but vague responses. You learned probing techniques to verify answers and decision criteria for when to escalate.

**Context Pre-Seeding Advantage**
Keeping the same chat thread from Ask Mode through subsequent phases loads files into context during discovery, which can create significant efficiency gains for research or implementation work.

**Escalation as Success**
Ask Mode succeeds when it reveals complexity requiring systematic research, not just when it provides complete answers. Recognizing escalation triggers is skill, not failure.

## What You Can Now Do

After completing this chapter, you can:

1. **Conduct disciplined 5-10 minute discovery sessions** using timeboxed Ask Mode with @workspace queries and the Broad→Narrow→Specific progression
2. **Recognize escalation triggers** and make evidence-based decisions about when to switch to Task Researcher
3. **Extract and verify resources** from AI responses, catching hallucinations before they become implementation bugs
4. **Build targeted learning paths** based on knowledge gaps discovered during research
5. **Create discovery artifacts** that accelerate subsequent Task Researcher or Planning phases
6. **Pre-seed context** by keeping the same chat thread from discovery through research

## Key Takeaways

### Ask Mode is reconnaissance, not implementation

* 5-10 minute discovery sessions build context rapidly without commitment
* Landscape → Filter → Exemplar → Convention → Decision pattern provides structure
* Lightweight notes capture findings without derailing momentum

### Question quality determines answer quality

* Broad questions establish landscape, specific questions get actionable details
* Context provision (project goals, constraints, attempted solutions) grounds answers in reality
* @workspace directive anchors Copilot to codebase, preventing generic advice

### Incomplete answers have recognizable patterns

* Generic advice signals insufficient context in question
* "It depends" without specifics signals need for disambiguation
* Missing citations signal shallow scanning versus deep analysis
* Probing techniques (request examples, ask comparisons, validate with files) verify answer quality

### Escalation decisions at 10 minutes

* Sufficient for implementation: Pattern clear, exemplar found, conventions understood
* Sufficient for focused research: Pattern identified but needs comprehensive documentation
* Insufficient: Multiple patterns unclear, contradictions, significant gaps

### Same-thread workflow multiplies efficiency

* Ask Mode loads 15-20 files into context during discovery
* Task Researcher starts "warm" instead of cold
* Research quality improves when context carries forward

## What's Next: Task Researcher Mode

Ask Mode gives you rapid discovery for straightforward patterns. But what happens when discovery reveals complexity? When you need comprehensive documentation? When the team needs evidence-based recommendations?

Chapter 6 introduces Task Researcher mode—systematic, artifact-producing research for complex investigations. You'll learn:

* When 5-10 minutes isn't enough: recognizing research-appropriate problems
* Research question framing using discoveries from Ask Mode
* Systematic research workflows producing markdown artifacts
* Evidence evaluation and synthesis for team decision-making
* Integration between Discovery (Ask Mode) and Research (Task Researcher) phases

Task Researcher transforms the questions Ask Mode can't answer into comprehensive, citable documentation. The modes complement each other—Ask Mode for rapid reconnaissance, Task Researcher for deep investigation.

**Progression reminder:** You've now completed Part II's Discovery foundation. Research phase (Chapter 6) follows naturally when discovery reveals insufficient clarity. Planning phase (Chapter 7) uses research artifacts to design implementation approach. Implementation phase (Chapter 8) executes with context-rich assistance.
