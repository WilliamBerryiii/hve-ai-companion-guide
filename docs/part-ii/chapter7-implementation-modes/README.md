## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Use Task Planner mode to create structured implementation plans from research documents
* Transform research findings into actionable implementation steps with clear sequencing
* Apply dependency analysis to identify prerequisite work and implementation order
* Create plan documents that serve as contracts between planning and implementation phases
* Recognize when a plan is "implementation-ready" and when it needs refinement
* Execute the research → plan handoff workflow for complex features

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before starting this chapter, verify you have:**

**Quiz - Are You Ready?**

1. ✅ Have you created a research document using Task Researcher mode? → [Review Chapter 6](../chapter6-planning-architecture-modes/)
2. ✅ Do you understand the Planning phase of RPI? → [Review Chapter 3, Section 3](../../part-i/chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/03-rpi-planning-phase.md)
3. ✅ Can you identify when research findings are sufficient for planning? → [Review Chapter 6, Section 5](../chapter6-planning-architecture-modes/05-summary.md)
4. ✅ Have you manually created implementation plans (from Chapter 4)? → [Review Chapter 4, Section 3](../../part-i/chapter4-first-workflow/03-manual-planning-phase.md)

If you answered "no" to any question, review the linked chapter before proceeding.
