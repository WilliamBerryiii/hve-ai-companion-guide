Part I establishes the foundation for effective AI-assisted development. You'll assess your codebase's readiness, configure a complete development environment, learn the RPI methodology, and execute your first complete workflow. These four chapters prepare you for the advanced chat modes and workflow patterns in Part II.

## What You'll Learn in Part I

Part I introduces the engineering fundamentals and methodology that make AI assistance effective:

* **Engineering readiness assessment** to identify codebase strengths and gaps
* **Complete environment setup** with hve-core, GitHub Copilot, and chat modes
* **The RPI methodology** (Research → Plan → Implement) for evidence-based development
* **Anti-hallucination strategies** to validate AI output before committing
* **Your first complete workflow** building real functionality from discovery through verification

By completing Part I, you'll have a working development environment and confidence to apply RPI in daily development work.

## Prerequisites

Part I is designed for all readers. Chapter 1 assumes no prior AI-assisted development experience.

**Before starting:**

* Development machine with administrative rights
* Active GitHub account
* Comfortable using command line/terminal
* Existing codebase to assess (or willingness to work with examples)

## Chapters in Part I

### Chapter 1: Is Your Codebase AI-Ready?

**Time:** 35-45 minutes | **Level:** Beginner

Understand why engineering fundamentals are prerequisites for AI effectiveness. AI assistance depends on what's discoverable in your codebase. Tests, linting, documentation, and source control create artifacts that AI can read and use. Assess your codebase using a standardized 1-20 point scoring framework and create a prioritized action plan to improve AI-readiness.

[Start Chapter 1](./chapter1-engineering-ready/README.md)

### Chapter 2: Setting Up Your AI Development Environment

**Time:** 45-60 minutes | **Level:** Beginner

Install and configure the complete hypervelocity engineering toolkit. Set up three essential layers: the hve-core framework for structured workflows, GitHub Copilot for AI assistance, and specialized chat modes for different engineering tasks. Verify your installation through systematic testing to ensure a fully working environment.

[Start Chapter 2](./chapter2-setup-environment/README.md)

### Chapter 3: The RPI Method - Research, Plan, Implement

**Time:** 60-75 minutes | **Level:** Beginner

Learn the RPI methodology, an evidence-based workflow that reduces AI hallucination risk through systematic validation. Understand the three-phase workflow, develop the "type transformation mindset" for working with AI, and practice anti-hallucination strategies. Execute a complete RPI cycle on a small refactoring task.

[Start Chapter 3](./chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/README.md)

### Chapter 4: Your First Complete Workflow

**Time:** 2 hours (reading + exercises) | **Level:** Beginner-Moderate

Scale up from Chapter 3's refactoring exercise to implement a complete new feature from scratch. Execute the full RPI workflow: research with Ask Mode, manual planning, implementation with inline Copilot, verification, and reflection. Build working email notification functionality and gain confidence to apply RPI in daily development work.

[Start Chapter 4](./chapter4-first-workflow/README.md)

## Estimated Time

Completing Part I requires 4-5 hours across four chapters. Chapter 4's hands-on workflow may require additional time depending on your codebase complexity.

## Reading Path Guidance

Follow the chapters sequentially (1-4). Each chapter builds on the previous:

1. **Assess** - Evaluate codebase readiness for AI assistance
2. **Setup** - Install and configure the complete development environment
3. **Learn** - Master the RPI methodology and evidence-based development
4. **Apply** - Execute a complete workflow building real functionality

> [!TIP]
> If your codebase scores below 12 on the readiness assessment in Chapter 1, consider addressing critical gaps before proceeding. The remaining chapters assume basic engineering fundamentals are in place.

## Ready to Begin?

Start with [Chapter 1: Is Your Codebase AI-Ready?](./chapter1-engineering-ready/README.md) to assess your codebase and establish the engineering foundations for effective AI-assisted development.
