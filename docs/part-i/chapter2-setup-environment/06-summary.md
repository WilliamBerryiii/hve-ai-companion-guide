You've completed the foundation of your AI-assisted development environment. This chapter walked you through installing GitHub Copilot, configuring the hve-core framework, setting up specialized chat modes, and optionally enhancing research capabilities with MCP servers.

Let's review what you've accomplished and prepare for the next step: learning the Research → Plan → Implement methodology.

## Key Takeaways

* **Three-layer setup**: Core prerequisites (VS Code, Node.js, Git, Copilot) → hve-core framework → Optional MCP enhancements
* **GitHub Copilot in VS Code requires two extensions**: "GitHub Copilot" for inline suggestions, "GitHub Copilot Chat" for modes
* **hve-core provides specialized modes**: Ask, Task Researcher, Task Planner, Edit, Agent - each optimized for specific tasks
* **Chat agents/modes selected via dropdown**: Agent picker in Copilot Chat sidebar provides access to all agents and custom chatmodes
* **Research and planning documents tracked**: `.copilot-tracking/research/` and `.copilot-tracking/planning/` directories
* **MCP extends research capabilities**: Authoritative external documentation and development operations integration
* **Systematic verification essential**: Test each mode to ensure environment ready for workflows

## What You Can Now Do

✓ Install and configure GitHub Copilot with appropriate subscription tier  
✓ Set up hve-core framework in your development projects  
✓ Access and switch between GitHub Copilot chat modes (Ask, Researcher, Planner, Edit, Agent)  
✓ Verify your installation systematically through hands-on testing  
✓ Configure optional MCP servers for enhanced research capabilities  
✓ Troubleshoot common installation and configuration issues  
✓ **Start using HVE workflows with confidence** (ready for Chapter 3!)

## Connection to Next Chapter

You have a fully configured HVE development environment:

* ✅ GitHub Copilot installed and authenticated
* ✅ hve-core framework configured
* ✅ Chat modes verified working
* ✅ Research/planning directories established

**Chapter 3 introduces the RPI Method** - the core workflow that uses these tools:

* **Research** phase (Task Researcher mode) - Evidence-based discovery
* **Plan** phase (Task Planner mode) - Implementation strategy
* **Implement** phase (Edit/Agent modes) - Execution with validation

**Why this progression matters:**

* Chapter 2: Installed the **tools**
* **Chapter 3**: Learn the **methodology** (RPI workflow)
* Chapters 4+: Apply methodology to increasingly complex scenarios

**Your environment is ready.** Chapter 3 teaches you how to use these tools systematically to prevent AI hallucination and deliver high-quality code with confidence.
