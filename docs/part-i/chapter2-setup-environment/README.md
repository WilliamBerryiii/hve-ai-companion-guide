Welcome to Chapter 2! You've completed the foundational assessment in Chapter 1 and verified your codebase has the engineering fundamentals for AI-assisted development. Now it's time to build your hypervelocity toolkit.

If you're feeling a bit nervous about all the tools we're about to install—that's completely normal. Many developers hesitate at setup chapters, worried about configuration complexity or compatibility issues. Here's the good news: we've designed this installation process to be straightforward, with clear verification steps at each stage. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a fully working environment—not a half-configured mess.

This chapter guides you through three essential installation layers. First, the hve-core framework structures your workflow. Second, GitHub Copilot powers AI assistance. Third, specialized chat modes optimize AI for different engineering tasks. By the end, you'll have a fully configured development environment ready for systematic, evidence-based engineering.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Install and configure the hve-core framework with all required dependencies
* Set up GitHub Copilot with appropriate subscription tier and extensions
* Configure VS Code for optimal AI-assisted development workflows
* Understand and switch between GitHub Copilot chat modes
* Verify your installation with confidence through systematic testing
* Configure optional MCP servers for enhanced research capabilities

## Before You Begin

Let's verify you're ready for installation and configuration.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before starting this chapter, verify you have:**

**Quiz - Are You Ready?**

1. ✅ Have you completed Chapter 1 and understand engineering fundamentals? → [Review Chapter 1](../chapter1-engineering-ready/)
2. ✅ Do you have administrative rights on your development machine? (Required for software installation)
3. ✅ Do you have an active GitHub account? (Required for Copilot access) → [Create account](https://github.com/signup)
4. ✅ Are you comfortable using command line/terminal? → [Review Ch 1, Section 3](../chapter1-engineering-ready/#section-3)

If you answered "no" to any question, review the linked chapter or acquire necessary permissions before proceeding.

## Chapter Contents

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

### [1. Introduction: Chapter Introduction & Setup Philosophy](01-introduction.md)

Understand how Chapter 2 builds on Chapter 1's fundamentals and discover what makes the Hypervelocity Engineering (HVE) approach different from standard Copilot usage. Learn the three-layer installation approach and what's in scope for this chapter.

**Reading time:** 5-7 minutes

### [2. GitHub Copilot Subscription & Installation](02-copilot-subscription.md)

Compare GitHub Copilot subscription tiers, verify your access, and install the GitHub Copilot extensions in VS Code. Learn the difference between chat sidebar and inline chat, and configure Copilot settings for optimal performance.

**Reading time:** 8-10 minutes

### [3. HVE-Core Framework Installation](03-hve-core-installation.md)

Install and configure the hve-core framework that enables specialized chat modes and structured AI workflows.

**Reading time:** 10-12 minutes

### [4. Chat Modes Configuration & Verification](04-chat-modes-configuration.md)

Configure and verify five specialized chat modes for different engineering tasks. Learn when to use each mode and troubleshoot common issues.

**Reading time:** 8-10 minutes

### [5. MCP Server Setup (Optional)](05-mcp-server-setup.md)

Optional MCP server configuration for enhanced research and development operations. Learn about available servers, installation steps, and when each server provides value.

**Reading time:** 12-15 minutes

### [6. Summary: Chapter Summary & Next Steps](06-summary.md)

Recap learning objectives, review key takeaways from installation and configuration, preview Chapter 3 (RPI Framework Fundamentals), and access related resources for continued learning.

**Reading time:** 3-5 minutes

Choose the path that matches your learning style and experience level.

## Recommended Path

**For linear learners:** Read sections 1-6 in order, completing installation steps as you progress.

**For experienced users:** If you already have GitHub Copilot and VS Code configured:

1. Skim sections 1-2 (5 minutes)
2. Focus on section 3 (hve-core installation)
3. Complete section 4 (chat modes verification)
4. Skip section 5 (MCP server) unless research enhancement is needed
5. Proceed to Chapter 3

**For role-specific readers:**

* **Engineers:** Complete all sections with hands-on installation and verification
* **Technical Program Managers:** Focus on sections 1, 3, and 4 to understand team tooling requirements
* **Business Program Managers:** Review sections 1 and 6 for overview, delegate installation to engineering teams

## Your Journey Through This Chapter

In the next 35-45 minutes, you'll build a complete AI-assisted development environment. By the end, you'll have:

**What you'll accomplish:**

* GitHub Copilot installed and configured with appropriate subscription tier
* hve-core framework cloned and dependencies installed
* Chat modes configured and verified with test exercises
* Complete development environment ready for Chapter 3
* Optional MCP server configured for enhanced research (if needed)

## What's Next

**In [Chapter 3: RPI Framework Fundamentals](../chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/):**

* Learn the Research → Plan → Implement (RPI) methodology
* Practice systematic research, planning, and implementation patterns
* Build confidence in structured AI-assisted development
