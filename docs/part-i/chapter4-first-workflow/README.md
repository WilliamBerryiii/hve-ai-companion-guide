Chapter 3 introduced the RPI method through concepts and a small refactoring exercise. Now you'll scale up to implement a **complete new feature** from scratch using the full RPI workflow. This is the capstone of Part I—after completing this chapter, you'll have the confidence to apply RPI in your daily development work.

## Table of Contents

* [Section 1: Introduction and Feature Selection](./01-introduction-feature-selection.md)
* [Section 2: Research Phase with Ask Mode](./02-research-phase-ask-mode.md) - Using Ask Mode for rapid codebase reconnaissance, verifying findings, and creating learning paths
* [Section 3: Manual Planning Phase](./03-manual-planning-phase.md)
* [Section 4: Implementation with Inline Copilot](./04-implementation-inline-copilot.md)
* [Section 5: Verification and Iteration](./05-verification-iteration.md)
* [Section 6: Lessons Learned and Reflection](./06-lessons-learned-reflection.md)
* [Section 7: Chapter Summary](./07-summary.md)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Execute a complete RPI cycle on a realistic feature from discovery through verification
* Use Ask Mode effectively for quick initial reconnaissance
* **Verify research findings** by extracting resources and checking claims against sources
* **Create learning paths** from knowledge gaps to fill critical gaps efficiently
* Create manual implementation plans before learning Task Planner in Chapter 7
* Apply inline GitHub Copilot suggestions strategically during implementation
* Apply the **Verify → Iterate → Reflect** cycle at each RPI phase
* Develop verification strategies to validate each implementation step
* Build a working feature you can demonstrate and add to your portfolio

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before starting this chapter, verify you have:

**Quiz - Are You Ready?**

1. ✅ Do you understand the three RPI phases (Research, Plan, Implement)? → [Review Chapter 3](../chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/)
2. ✅ Can you recognize Type 1-4 inputs and when to use each? → [Review Chapter 3, Section 3](../chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/03-type-transformation-mindset.md)
3. ✅ Have you completed the refactoring exercise from Chapter 3? → [Review Chapter 3 Exercise](../chapter3-rpi-fundamentals/04-standard-exercise.md)
4. ✅ Do you have a working development environment with tests? → [Review Chapter 1](../chapter1-engineering-ready/)

If you answered "no" to any question, review the linked chapter before proceeding.

## Time Commitment

**Reading time:** 40-50 minutes  
**Exercise time:** 45-60 minutes for complete feature implementation  
**Total commitment:** ~2 hours including hands-on practice

This chapter guides you through implementing a complete feature: adding email notification functionality when users complete their profile. You'll research email patterns, create an implementation plan, build the feature using inline Copilot, verify it works end-to-end, and reflect on what you learned. By the end, you'll have working code demonstrating your ability to execute the full RPI workflow.
