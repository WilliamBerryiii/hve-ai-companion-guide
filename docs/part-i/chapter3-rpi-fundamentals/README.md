## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this chapter, you'll complete your first full RPI workflow—taking a refactoring task from uncertain requirements to working, tested code. You'll practice researching with Ask Mode, planning with Task Planner, and implementing with Edit Mode.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Understand the three-phase RPI workflow and why each phase matters
* Apply evidence-based development to reduce AI hallucination risk
* Recognize when to invest more time in research vs. planning vs. implementation
* Execute a complete RPI cycle on a small refactoring task
* Develop the type transformation mindset for working with AI

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before starting this chapter, verify you have:**

**Quiz - Are You Ready?**

1. ✅ Have you completed the hve-core installation? → [Review Chapter 2](../chapter2-setup-environment/)
2. ✅ Can you switch between chat modes in VS Code? → [Review Chapter 2, Section 4](../chapter2-setup-environment/04-chat-modes-configuration.md)
3. ✅ Do you understand why engineering fundamentals matter? → [Review Chapter 1](../chapter1-engineering-ready/)

If you answered "no" to any question, review the linked chapter before proceeding.

> [!NOTE]
> This chapter references custom chat modes (Task Researcher, Task Planner, Agent Mode) provided by hve-core. These are not native GitHub Copilot features. Ensure you've completed Chapter 2's hve-core installation before proceeding.
