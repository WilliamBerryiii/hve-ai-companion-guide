In February 2025, the core Edge-AI development team made a decision that would fundamentally change how we write software: from that point forward, we would write 100% of our code using GitHub Copilot. Not as a writing assistant. Not as a productivity boost. But as my primary development interface.

That decision didn't come from blind faith in AI. It came from months of wrestling with a problem developing Edge-AI ... how do you train a team to work at hypervelocity when the tools keep evolving faster than the training materials?

We had built something remarkable: an AI-native cloud and edge computing platform and context space that went from concept to production in ~ nine months, a timeline that would have taken years using traditional approaches. But our success created a new challenge. The workflows we'd developed were embedded in a massive, complex codebase that served as a barrier to adoption rather than a pathway.

I started documenting our approach through what became the #SeasonOfHVE blog series, exploring how we transformed development velocity through structured AI collaboration. But blogs and documentation wasn't enough. People needed a different format, something self-paced and comprehensive. They needed this book.

## Why AI Amplifies What You Already Have

Here's the uncomfortable truth we learned: AI doesn't make bad engineers good or good engineers great automatically. AI amplifies what you already have. If your codebase is chaos, AI will help you create chaos faster. If your fundamentals are weak, AI will compound your weaknesses at scale.

But if you have solid engineering fundamentals ... comprehensive tests, clear architectural decisions, organized code structure, a clean git history, than AI becomes a force multiplier that's hard to overstate. The discoverability principle is everything: AI can only help you build on what it can find and understand.

This realization shifted our entire approach. The question wasn't "How do I prompt better?" It was "How do I structure my work so AI can amplify my default engineering practices instead of my worst habits?"

## The Research → Plan → Implement Framework

The answer emerged through what we now call the RPI framework: Research → Plan → Implement. Three distinct phases, three specialized agents (Task Researcher, Task Planner, Task Implementer), and a diagnostic power that comes from phase separation.

When something goes wrong, and it will, you can identify exactly where the breakdown occurred. Did the research miss critical context? Did the plan fail to account for constraints? Did the implementation drift from the structure? This diagnostic capability transformed how our team approaches problem-solving.

What makes RPI remarkable is its timelessness. As context windows expand and models improve, the framework adapts. You're not learning tool-specific tricks that become obsolete in six months. You're learning a systematic approach to AI-assisted development that will work regardless of which models or tools emerge next.

## What Changed for Me and My Team

Personally, this approach transformed my communication. I became better at setting expectations, at articulating what I needed, at breaking down complex problems into structured phases. The meta-cognitive shift was profound: I stopped solving immediate problems and started solving the meta-problems that generated classes of solutions.

For my team, the transformation was even more dramatic. We started working in larger units, spending more review time on fewer but more substantial changes. We caught errors earlier because our structured approach made problems visible faster. Our workflows became predictable and repeatable, even as we tackled novel challenges.

The learning curve for my team, arguably pioneers figuring all this out in real-time, was four to six months. I expect it to be shorter for you, having the chance to now, work with stable tools and clear guidance.

## Why Your Career Depends on This

Let me be direct: your career depends on becoming proficient in AI-assisted development. This isn't hyperbole. AI-assisted development is here to stay, and the developers who learn to work effectively with these tools will separate themselves from those who don't.

The biggest mistake I see is people giving up too early, concluding "AI isn't ready" or "it doesn't work for my domain." What I've learned is that AI works across all project types and domains ... brownfield, greenfield, legacy systems, cutting-edge platforms. The variable isn't whether AI can help. The variable is whether you have the engineering fundamentals in place for AI to amplify.

## Who This Guide Serves

I wrote this guide for two groups. First, new adopters who are just beginning their AI-assisted development journey and need a systematic approach rather than scattered tips. Second, frustrated practitioners who tried AI tooling, felt disappointed, and need a framework to understand why their initial attempts fell short.

If you're in either group, this guide will show you how to structure your engineering practice so AI becomes a genuine force multiplier rather than an expensive autocomplete.

## Acknowledgments

This work wouldn't exist without Allen Greaves, whose early pioneering of agent-based approaches showed what was possible. Katrien De Graeve, whose vision for Edge-AI created the context for these discoveries. Larry Lieberman, Chris Risner, Leigh Tami, David Ruttka, and Eliise Seling, whose collaboration pushed the boundaries of what we thought achievable. To Dan Massey who gave Edge-AI the room to find life.

Thank you to Machteld Bögels, Emmeline Hoops, and Olha Konstantinova for their dedication to making hve-core accessible. To the entire Edge-AI core team, who lived through the messy early iterations and helped refine these practices under pressure. To Matt Dotson, who told me I should get into this Copilot thing. And to my daughters, Mia who showed me how using AI can improve communication skills and Adelyn, who helped review parts of this book.

## Your Path Forward

The Edge-AI platform exists as proof: nine months from concept to production for a system that would have taken years traditionally. We used the RPI framework to build the guide you're reading, meta-programming in its purest form.

My hope is simple: "follow the fun" with AI. When you discover workflows that make development enjoyable again, when you find yourself solving problems at a scale you couldn't before, when you start thinking in terms of meta-solutions rather than point fixes ... that's when you know it's working.

The fundamentals you'll learn here are timeless. The framework adapts as tools evolve. And the career stakes couldn't be higher.

Let's begin.
